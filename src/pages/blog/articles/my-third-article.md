Cultural

A vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion, India holds a large global presence as well as a rich history and culture. Religion plays a big part in social and political dynamic, particularly the caste system as part of Hinduism.
The Caste System is a system that divides Hindus into groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras and Dalits (also known as the untouchables). The hierarchical structure has determined the jobs of Hindus for hundreds of years, with Brahmins being priests and teachers, Kshatriya’s warriors, and rulers, all the way down to Dalits, who are given menial jobs like street sweeping. Despite affirmative action and social change reducing the impact of the caste system, it still plays a massive role in inequality in India.

50% of all poor children in India belong to the Dalit Caste, highlighting the disparity the caste system has caused. This has led to limited opportunities to remove themselves from the poverty trap, as well as discouraging them from attending school. This is because many children are forced into child labour to provide their families with income. Many girls are forced into child marriages, with 18.2% of Dalit girls under the age of 15 being illegally married off between 2005 and 2006.

As well as this, those from the Dalit community are ostracized from the education system because they are considered ‘untouchable’, and other parents of higher castes do not want their children to be associated with them, leading to further social divides. Within classrooms, Dalit students are segregated from their schoolmates, having to sit and eat away from them, and often forced to take on extra duties like cleaning the classrooms and toilets. This explains the higher dropout rates and low attendance. In 2013 alone, India had 47 million who had dropped out of education before the age of 15, presumably with the main factors being caste and forced labour. Furthermore, despite a recent rise in attendance (from 64% to 77%), this is still behind the 84% seen from higher castes.

This holdback in education has caused lower castes to remain in absolute poverty, due to having no academic qualifications to empower them to leave the poverty trap. This is especially the case for girls of a lower caste, increasing the gap between male and female education, and then the male and female pay gap further along the line. Not only does it keep them in poverty, but impacts their mental health too, due to the maltreatment of members from other castes, and the discrimination they face in both their day to day life, as well as when trying to find work.

In order to help overcome these barriers, the government have put measures in place to equalise education and opportunities for everyone such as the Right to Education Act, which guarantees education for all students aged 6-14. In addition, there are affirmative action schemes such as ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ (roughly translates to save girls, educate girls) and is focused on transforming the perception of women, with a focus on women of lower castes. In addition, universities and schools follow quotas, so a certain number of students must be from lower castes. For example, the Union government requires that 27% of university spaces should be saved for low-income students from scheduled castes and tribes and “other backward classes”.

There is still much work to be done. The culture in schools still segregates children of lower castes, and many are given less opportunities in terms of entrance exam preparation due to having less income. University quotas are often contested and brought to court or are not implemented properly. Furthermore, they are rarely given the same treatment as higher castes, leaving them to feel isolated. The next steps for government officials should be to invest heavily in state education and enforce caste discrimination laws within schools especially, to pull future generations of lower castes out of the poverty trap.
